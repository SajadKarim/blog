Under the name "DevelopersGrid", I have successfully completed numerous freelance projects utilizing a wide range of technologies across different application types. These projects include server-side applications developed using C++, C#, VC++, Win32, and Asp.net, as well as client-side applications created with C# and Win32. Additionally, I have developed web applications using PHP and the MVC-II framework. The projects span various domains such as QA automation tools, order management and data feed servers, risk management systems, FIX protocol-based adapters, online trading portals, and more. This diverse portfolio demonstrates my ability to adapt and deliver high-quality solutions in both desktop and web environments, often collaborating with hired professionals or friends to complete the projects.

DevelopersGrid initially started as a personal endeavor. Over time, several talented developers joined the team. Today, we continue to collaborate on numerous projects, offering solutions and consultancy services.
