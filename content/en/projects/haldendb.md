> The Markhor/Ibex (Halden in Burushaski), a majestic wild goat species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, is renowned for its distinctive corkscrew horns and impressive agility in rugged terrains. It faces predation challenges from formidable carnivores such as snow leopards, wolves, Eurasian lynx, and brown bears. The golden eagle has been reported to prey upon young markhor. To survive in these harsh environments, Markhors and Ibexes have developed remarkable adaptations. Their keen senses, including exceptional eyesight and acute hearing, help them detect approaching predators from a distance. Additionally, their powerful climbing abilities allow them to navigate steep and rocky terrain, providing escape routes from potential threats. These ungulates also exhibit a strong herding behavior, with individuals collectively vigilant against predators. The combination of physical prowess, keen senses, and social structures enhances their chances of survival in the challenging ecosystems they call home.

## The Project

This C++ project is an ongoing effort to explore and implement various B<sup>$\epsilon$</sup>-Tree and B<sup>+</sup>-Tree variants. Designed as a resource for both educational and practical applications, it aims to provide insights into the different optimizations and uses of B<sup>$\epsilon$</sup>-Tree and B<sup>+</sup>-Tree in databases and filesystems. As work progresses, the project will feature implementations ranging from basic structures suitable for learning purposes to more advanced versions optimized for specific challenges such as concurrency and cache efficiency. Contributors are welcome to join in this evolving exploration of one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science.

The project currently includes the following modules:
- **libcache**: A library for managing cache operations, including LRUCache.
- **libbtree**: The main library for implementing various B<sup>$\epsilon$</sup>-Tree and B<sup>+</sup>-Tree variants.
- **sandbox**: A utility for debugging and validating functionality.
- **test_all**: A unit testing suite.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
