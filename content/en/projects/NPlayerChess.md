This was an academic project conducted during the course "Clean Code Development." We were provided with a 2-Player Chess game and were tasked with transforming it into a 3-Player Chess game. During this transformation, we adhered to SOLID principles and utilized tools for code management and Continuous Integration (CI) servers.

Our core logic is based on XML. We have made significant efforts to ensure the game is highly configurable, with the input XML defining the board layout, pieces, rules, and players. XML configurations for 2 and 3 players (with two variations â€“ hexagon and circle) are already included in source control. Additional board configurations can be defined using the same pattern. (A detailed architecture diagram will be added under the documentation section of the code.)

The base code used in this project was sourced from the following location: [Java Open Chess 1.0.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/javaopenchess/files/1.0.1/joChess-1.0.1-sources.zip/download)
