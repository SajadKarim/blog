Navrouz Mubarak! 

Navrouz is the Persian New Year celebrated on the spring equinox, marking the first day of the Persian solar calendar. With roots in Zoroastrianism, this festival has been observed for over 3,000 years and symbolizes renewal, balance, and new beginnings. It is celebrated with traditions like cleaning homes, preparing a Haft Sin table with symbolic items, and spending time with loved ones. I belong to one of the communities that joyfully celebrates this day, cherishing our deep connection with nature. We celebrate it on the 21st of March, and since it is Navrouz tomorrow, so I wish..

> May this Navroz bring light to our hearts, peace to our souls, and strength to our spirits. 
>
> May the season of renewal fill our lives with hope, joy, and countless blessings.
>
> May the wisdom of our Imam guide our path, today and always.
>
> May we walk forward in unity, faith, and stewardship, caring for one another and the world around us.
>
> Ameen. 

Along with this, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who sent me kind birthday wishes. I made the following word cloud out of the texts/emails :)

Lastly, I would turn the page in my life's chapter with the following..

Thereâ€™s strength in letting go, a power in choosing yourself, in understanding that the love you give is not a weakness, but a testament to who you are.

Let's close the chapter, not with anger, not with despair, but with hope, hope that you will find peace in the silence and joy in the spaces yet to be filled.
