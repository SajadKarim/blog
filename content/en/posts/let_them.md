_**If they want to walk out of your life and leave, hold the door open, AND LET THEM..**_

A couple of months ago, I came across this line. At the time, I was surprised to see it pop up in my feed and simply scrolled past it. It appeared again over the weekend. I initially dismissed it, assuming it was just a passing thought from someone who had experienced an unpleasant relationship. However, curiosity eventually got the better of me, and I decided to search for the source. That was when I discovered the entire poem.

The poem is truly beautiful, filled with wisdom and powerful life lessons. It delves into themes of _**self-worth**_, _**setting boundaries**_, and _**embracing the courage to let go—qualities**_ we often find difficult to embody. Its central message emphasizes the importance of allowing others to reveal their true selves through actions rather than words. By _**letting them**_ make their choices, whether to drift away, misunderstand you, or prioritize other things, _**  you come to understand that their behavior reflects their own values, not your worth**_.

The poem is a call to _**honor your own dignity and individuality**_. It serves as a reminder to _**let people earn their place in your life instead of holding on to relationships that no longer serve you**_. Ultimately, _**it is a testament to the beauty of resilience, keeping an open heart, and waiting for genuine, reciprocated love and connection. It offers a powerful message of strength, wrapped in gentle self-love**_.


I also found a video of a lovely and elegant lady reading this poem. This video is now part of my playlist, as she reminds me of my beloved sweet maama.

You cannot force a heart to stay. Love must flow, unbound, unchained, not begged, nor bought, nor tightly claimed.
Though it hurts to let them go, a love that is real will stay and freely grow. The earlier you embrace letting go, the less you'll endure—maybe even not at all!
