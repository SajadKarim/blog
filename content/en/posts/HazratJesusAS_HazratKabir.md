Today, a video popped up on my YouTube feed about a correspondence between a well-known Pakistani actress (Madam Noor Jehan) and Ayatollah Khomeini. I was, thb to some extent, surprised to learn that Madam Noor Jehan was a Shia and a follower of Khomeini. The title caught my attention because Madam Noor Jehan was very influential. I wanted to find out what she would have written to Khomeini about.

When the presenter mentioned music, I knew Khomeini would likely have given a fatwa that it was prohibited in Islam. This is a common misconception among many Muslims, both Sunni and Shia. However, there are also Muslims who believe that music is completely acceptable and not sinful, which is my view as well. I watched the video to the end to see Khomeini's response, and it stunned me.

In her letter, Madam Noor Jehan asked Khomeini for a fatwa on how to perform Nazar or Nyaz (a noble charity act) in the name of Imam Hussain A.S. She wanted to know if it was permissible. Khomeini's response was quite disturbing for her (and many like her). In his response, he equated the money earned from singing or acting to pig's urine. In summary, such money is not just unacceptable but disgustingly haram, and it couldn't be used for charity or personal use, just like pig is haram in Islam.

Anyhow, this reminded me of a quote from Hazrat Kabir and a historic event from Prophet Jesus (SWA).

>When I went to look for the bad, I did not find anyone bad.

>When I searched my heart, I found no one worse than me.

> _Kabir_ [1]


>In the passage, Jesus was teaching in the Temple after coming from the Mount of Olives. A group of scribes and Pharisees confronts Jesus, interrupting his teaching. They bring in a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she was caught in the very act. They tell Jesus that the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by Mosaic Law.[4][5][6] Jesus begins to write something on the ground using his finger; when the woman's accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone at her. The accusers depart, realizing not one of them is without sin either, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her and she answers no. Jesus says that he too does not condemn her and tells her to go and sin no more.

The above two excerpts from the mystic poet Kabir and the other recounting an incident involving Prophet Jesus (Isa) emphasize self-reflection and humility.

Kabir's verse highlights the introspective journey of seeking faults in others, only to realize one's own shortcomings. This sentiment aligns with the teachings of Prophet Jesus (SAW) in the Gospel of John, where he addresses the accusers of a woman caught in adultery. By stating, "Let the one among you who is without sin cast the first stone," Jesus (SAW) redirects the focus from judging others to acknowledging one's own imperfections. This approach led her accusers to depart, recognizing their own flaws. Jesus then tells the woman, "Go, and from now on no longer sin," emphasizing forgiveness coupled with a call for personal transformation.

Both narratives encourage looking inward before passing judgment on others, fostering a sense of empathy and self-awareness. They remind us that recognizing our own faults is a prerequisite for understanding and compassion towards others.
