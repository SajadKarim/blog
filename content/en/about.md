Sajad Karim was born in Karimabad, a small and beautiful town in Hunza, located in northern Pakistan. He spent his early childhood surrounded by nature, but later moved to Karachi, where he lived most of his life. He began his education at Al-Azhar Academy, a school in his neighborhood, where he laid the groundwork for his academic journey.


For college, Karim studied at Marli Cantonment Science College, choosing computer science. The college was far from his home, and he had to take two buses to get there. At that time, he didn’t know much about navigating Karachi, but he managed to adjust and complete his FSC. Later, he went on to Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology, where he graduated with a degree in computer engineering, setting the stage for his career in technology.

As a child, Karim loved playing cricket. He would play at home with his twin brother and outside with friends. He was an all-rounder, enjoying both batting and experimenting with bowling techniques. At one point, he learned to swing the ball with medium pace. However, as he grew older, other things became more important, and he gradually left cricket behind.


In his free time, Karim enjoys hiking and camping. Being in nature helps him relax and recharge. He also likes gardening and spending time in the countryside, where he feels at peace. Staying close to nature is something he values deeply.

Karim also enjoys watching movies, especially comedies. He often watches his favorite movies more than once, particularly Bollywood comedies, as those were the ones he had access to growing up. While he enjoys science fiction and fantasy, he avoids movies with violence or sad endings. For him, movies should have happy endings since they are something we can control.

When it comes to music, Karim listens to all kinds—from classical to pop and rock. Recently, he has started enjoying folk music from his hometown, which helps him stay connected to his roots. Whether it’s through nature, movies, or music, Sajad finds simple ways to enjoy life and stay balanced.
